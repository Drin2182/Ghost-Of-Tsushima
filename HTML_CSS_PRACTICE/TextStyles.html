        <p class="a">I was not prepared for the emotional power of Ghost of Tsushima, nor for it’s lushness and hyper-visual, dreamlike fantasy. “Affecting” is a word I used a lot to describe it to my colleagues, because the journey of Jin Sakai did affect me. Tsushima draws on the legacy of samurai movies to create a game that translates that genre to its own medium, thriving in the tense silences before a standoff and the violent beauty of revenge. I enjoyed it for reasons I don’t normally enjoy games, and consider its ability to make me notice elements of game design I’ve never blinked an eye at a unique triumph. <br><br>

        As I played I thought it was fitting that Ghost of Tsushima will be the last exclusive to be released in the Playstation 4’s lifetime, a coda to everything developers have achieved with this console before its power is eclipsed by the Playstation 5. It is not perfect, but it is in a lot of ways a summation of what gameplay and storytelling can look like now, as unfathomable as it may have seemed five, ten, twenty years ago
